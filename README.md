# AcadVault â€” Student Portal Components

## Overview

AcadVault is a set of modular UI components and flows for a modern student portal, designed to centralize academic tasks and resources in one place. The project is created and iterated in v0.app and automatically synced to this repository, with deployments handled by Vercel.

Use these components to assemble a complete portal or embed specific flows into an existing app.

## Project Idea (What this aims to solve)

- Provide students with a single hub for courses, resources, schedules, and announcements.
- Streamline common actions like viewing assignments, tracking progress, and managing submissions.
- Offer simple, reusable components that can be adapted to different institutions or use cases.
